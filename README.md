# **Web-Based Text Encryption Using AES**

## **Project Overview**  
This project is a web-based application designed to encrypt and decrypt text using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, ensuring secure communication and data confidentiality. Users can input plain text, encrypt it, and then decrypt it back to its original form using a secure key.

## **Features**  
- Text encryption and decryption using AES algorithm.
- User-friendly web interface.
- Secure handling of sensitive data with AES encryption.
- Input validation to ensure proper format for encryption and decryption.
- Clear and easy-to-understand output display.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript   
- **Encryption Algorithm:** AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)  
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** CryptoJS (for JavaScript encryption)  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Input Text:** The user enters the plain text they wish to encrypt.
2. **Encryption:** The input text is encrypted using the AES algorithm with a user-defined key.
3. **Decryption:** The user can decrypt the text using the same key.
4. **Result:** The encrypted and decrypted text is displayed for the user.

## **Installation**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kushalava917/textencrypt.git
   ```
   
2. Run the application on a local server.

## **Usage**  
- Open the application in your browser.
- Input the text you wish to encrypt and the secret key.
- Click "Encrypt" to encrypt the text.
- Use the same key to decrypt the encrypted text.
